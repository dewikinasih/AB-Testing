# AB-Testing
This repository consists of the self project for practicing my statistical knowledge of hypothesis testing and its application on marketing field. I assess the effectivenes of marketing strategies by A/B testing then analyze the result to make recommendations. Besides that, I also create simple linear regression model to examine the effect of dependent variable on the outcome variable

For this project, I used dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chebotinaa/fast-food-marketing-campaign-ab-test) which titled Fast Food Marketing Campaign A/B Test. Supposed that I am a Data Analyst at a fast-food chain. The product team plans to add a new item to our menu. However, they are still undecided between three possible marketing campaigns for promoting the new product.

In order to determine which promotion has the greatest effect on sales, the new item is introduced at locations in several randomly selected market. A different promotion is used at each location, and the weekly sales of the new item are recorded for the first four weeks.

So, the manager asked me to evaluate A/B testing results and decide which marketing staretgy works best for new product launching based on the result. Our objective in this project is basically to decide marketing strategy for the next month based on the greatest effect on sales

This following list is points of recommendation that can be used based on the result

- Promotion 1 had the greatest effect on sales, so does promotion 3 even though there is a statistical differences between them. Therefore it is recommended to consider using promotion 1 or it’s combination with promotion 3 instead of promotion 2 that perform worst in this experiment.
- Medium market size which has the most number of stores with moderate age show the best performance in every promotion strategies. So it can be considered to be our target market in order to increasing overall sales of new product.
- Store’s age affect the sales generated. Therefore, it is recommended to consider store age when designing marketing strategies. For example, because the younger stores lead to higher total sales, we could pay attention to implement this plan in store that relativily new. We also should make any innovations to  the older stores so that they had better performance.
